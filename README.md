# What is Excel Command?
Excel Command is free software for easy control of measuring instruments. 
Communication commands can be written in an Excel file and sent and received by various communication interfaces. 
Our goal is to create a calibration automation software like Fluke's MET/CAL in the future.

# Features
- Works with ExcelVBA (spreadsheet macro language) and TMCTL.DLL. Any installation work is not required.
- Communicates with measuring instruments via GP-IB, RS232, USB, or LAN.
- Controls and measures up to 8 measuring instruments.
- Japanese and English text can be switched.
- The VBA part is released as open source software.

# Target devices
- Measuring instruments compliant with IEEE488.2-1989

# Operating environment
- OS：Windows 2000, XP, Vista, 7, 8, 10, 11
- Excel：2010, 2013, 2016, 2019, 2021
  - Office for Mac and Microsoft 365 are not supported.

# Communication interface
- GP-IB: Environment in which National Instruments GP-IB interface works.
  - Install [NI-488.2](https://www.ni.com/ja-jp/support/downloads/drivers/download.ni-488-2.html) separately.
- RS232C: Environment in which serial port or virtual COM port operates.
- LAN: Socket communication, VXI-11, or HiSLIP must work.
